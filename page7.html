                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5"><em>Abstract</em>: The paper will look at how the archives can improve digital finding aids to make them more user-friendly. By looking at two university finding aids as case studies, this paper concludes the three most important elements that finding aids should improve upon now: visualizations, terminologies, and structures. It also suggests bringing in other disciplines, such as museum studies, digital humanities, and user-experience fields to provide more insights for future digital finding aids.&nbsp;<div><em><br></em></div><div><em>Keywords</em>: archival finding aids, user-friendliness, user-experience design, digital humanity &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Archivists create finding aids for their collections in order to make them more accessible and searchable for the users. However, it has been an ongoing challenge for the archivists to create more user-friendly finding aids. Users often find finding aids confusing and hard to navigate. This paper attempts to address finding aids’ discrepancies between the archivists and the users, and how to improve the design of archival finding aids by reviewing two university finding aids. After that, the paper will draw from different disciplines to suggest helpful references and potential solutions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>History of Finding Aids&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The finding aid is a subject that is much discussed in the archival field, since it is an important tool to bridge archivists and users. The Society of American Archivists (SAA) defines a finding aid as 1. A tool that facilitates discovery of information within a collection of records; 2. A description of records that gives the repository physical and intellectual control over the materials and that assists users to gain access to and understand the materials (1). It is important to note that these two definitions emphasize that finding aids go both ways; it is not exclusively for archivists, nor for users. Yet, when finding aids migrate from analog to digital, user-friendliness becomes an important factor that is previously unforeseen. The following will describe more of its transition.&nbsp;</div><br><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within the United States archival context, the finding aids encompass a wide variety of formats, including but not limited to index cards, inventories, and container lists. Initially, finding aids are more for administrative purposes, helping archivists to identify, analyze, collect, and control their collections. Yet as scientific research increases its demand in the latter half of the 18th century, archivists begin to do item-level descriptions that help researchers better understand their materials, which blur the line between arrangement and description of the collections. For the more modern approach of archival science, which emerge in the 19th century, archivists begin to focus more on provenance (respect de fonds) and original order, putting the arrangement in front of description (2).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finding aids then go through dramatic changes when the web emerge a few decades ago. As cataloger J. Gordon Daines III &amp; archivist Cory L. Nimer write in their article “What Do You Mean It Doesn’t Make Sense? Redesigning Finding Aids From the User’s Perspective” that the “ability to access information digitally is changing the way that users access information about archival and other research collections” (3). During the age of analog finding aids, users depend heavily on archivists to help them retrieve information that they desired. Therefore at that time, the finding aids are more for archivists than users, since they have limited interactions with them. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, as finding aids turn digital, archivists are no longer the only users of finding aids, since they are now accessible via the web. The users can simply go online, look at the finding aids, and locate the materials they want. Therefore, the urgency to design user-friendly finding aids becomes more crucial. Unlike analog finding aids, digital finding aids slowly revolutionize the ways in which the archivists and the users view and use them, since they are so malleable than static analog finding aids. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Literature Review</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the past few decades as digital finding aids become more prominent, increasing amount of scholarly research and articles begin to emerge. Finding aids are not something the archivists have total control of any more, as more and more users prefer digital finding aids as their primary means of accessing archives’ collections, rather than go to archives physically to ask for the archivists’ assistance (4). With more and more users depend on digital finding aids, they have often been criticized as hard to use, but that is not something the archivists deliberately do as Lawrence Dowler analyzes the problem more than three decades ago that it is difficult for the archivists to develop user-friendly finding aids since they barely have any ideas of how the users utilize them (5).</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, the archivists and the scholars are trying to understand and improve in the past two decades, as seen more and more usability research regarding finding aids appear. In 2001, Burt Altman and John R. Nemmers conduct a usability study with Claude Pepper Library collection’s online finding aid in Florida State University. The results are generally positive with users claiming that it is helpful to understand the collection by navigating through the finding aid, but suggest that it can add item-level descriptions to make the collection clearer (6). In 2004, Jihyun Kim conducts usability research focusing on Encoded Archival Standard (EAD), its implementations on the finding aids. She concludes that EAD finding aids should provide more control access headings, so the users have more ways to discover the collections; labels should be easier to understand; browse list should be more clearly listed, and search function should also be improved, since it is more widely used than the browse function (7).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some other scholarly pieces look at specific finding aids that help identify the pros and the cons. In 2011, J. Gordon Daines III and Cory L. Nimer look at Brigham Young University’s finding aid as a proof to show that single-level display can transform the performance of the finding aid and potentially improve user-experience (8). In 2017, Rachel Walton in her article “Looking for Answers: A Usability Study of Online Finding Aid Navigation”, she analyzes Princeton University's finding aid and discovers several problems that need to be improved in the usability research. The paper will explore these two case studies further later on. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No matter what aspects of those scholarly researches focus on, whether they are the descriptions, the interfaces, or the archival standards, almost all of them can be boiled down to several main points that will be helpful to improve the overall finding aids: hierarchical display of finding aid information, item-level access, text blocks, and terminology (9).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although there is substantial amount of research on finding aids’ usability, there is a lack of literature that ties archival finding aids into other disciplines of studies. One of the biggest problems for finding aid is the lack of visuals. In “Conceptual Data Visualization in Archival Finding Aids: Preliminary User Responses”, Anne Bahde attempts to bring in the digital humanities field to turn abstract data into visualizations to make finding aids more searchable and interactive. Besides this research, archival scholarly pieces generally look only in the archival field. This paper tries to fill in the gaps by bringing in other disciplines, such as museum studies, digital humanities, and user experience design. Those fields have the potential to provide insights towards developing more user-friendly finding aids. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Case Studies&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As mentioned previously, this paper will review two research projects regarding two finding aids: a Princeton University finding aid and a Brigham Young University finding aid from the articles “Looking for Answers: A Usability Study of Online Finding Aid Navigation” and “Re-Imagining Archival Display: Creating User-Friendly Finding Aids” respectively. After reviewing them, the paper will analyze and make conclusions referring to the authors’ opinions on what are the top three most important elements that finding aids should improve on right now.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In “Looking for Answers: A Usability Study of Online Finding Aid Navigation”, Walton conducts usability research looking at what are the difficulties a group of relatively inexperienced users (10 undergraduate English-speaking students without any vision, hearing, or motor impairments) have when they navigate through the Princeton University finding aid website.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Princeton University finding aid greets its users with a relatively clean interface. It is easy to find the search bar that is located in the middle of the interface. Down below, the users can explore by “topics”, “names”, and “collections” (10). After typing in subjects and clicking enter, the finding aid provides a useful sidebar that labels “repository”, “online access”, “subject”, “genre”, “language”, and “collection” for the ease of categorizing the collections (11). When entering the desired subject, there is another sidebar that will show the whole structure of the finding aid, which is helpful for the users to navigate through the information they are seeking (12).</div></h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From her usability survey, Walton concludes that in general, the users are satisfied with the experience. The interface is clean and clear, and the users do not have a hard time finding what they want. However, there are still places for improvements. First is the lack of visuals. In general, finding aids describe the collection rather than have pictures of the collection, because unlike museums, documents are predominantly what archives collect. However, as archives’ collections expand and become more diverse, it is not clear to just “describe” the items, since it can be subjective and inconsistent, as shown in the blog post from the UAA/APU Consortium Library that “I believe that all archivists approach the description process itself differently—we each have different and unique ways we consider information. I also know that the process I take to describe one collection may not be the same process I use on the next collection” (13). Some other complaints include difficulties to find the biography information of the creators (the finding aid puts it in a separate page). In conclusion, she mentions 10 major points that archivists should take into account when developing finding aids, including clear structures, avoid jargons, and increase visuals.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In another study, “Re-Imagining Archival Display: Creating User-Friendly Finding Aids”, J. Gordon Daines, III and Cory L. Nimer advocate single-level display believing that it could more clearly show how the finding aid is supposed to be. They use Brigham Young University finding aid to prove their points. To keep the interface with minimum text, the users see a very clean homepage that has a search bar in the middle, and a small gray box on the right titled “site navigation” with subjects such as “browse” and “help” (14). The texts are also kept in minimum as only essential details are present. The information such as “extant” and “call number” are on the top and the users can click through more information “full detail” and “admin info” on the bottom (15).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></h3>

Moreover, they stress the importance of terminologies that aim to be easy to understand and a clear interface for smooth navigation. They also acknowledge the duel needs of finding aids as administrative and access tool, but should not “drive user-interface design decisions” (16).&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While analyzing different finding aids, it is important to remember that even though all finding aids share similar elements and goals, they vary due to the fact that different institutions have their own focuses and priorities. Some institutions might focus more on standards, while others might emphasize more on the descriptions of the collections. However, the purposes of the finding aids are all the same “preservation of historically and administratively valuable documents, and public access to those preserved materials” (17). As digital finding aids become more wide-used, public access aspect becomes increasingly important. Therefore, though it is crucial to put into considerations that institutions are all different, basic accessibility functions and user experiences are all similar.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Case Studies Analysis</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the two case studies: Princeton University Finding Aid and Brigham Young University Finding Aid, the paper will choose and analyze three most important elements that the finding aids should improve upon to make them more user-friendly: visuals, terminologies, and structures. The paper is also going to suggest bringing in other fields, such as museum catalogs and digital humanities that might further advance finding aids.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In general, archival finding aids lack visualizations. In this case, the visualizations include static images showing the collections and visual cues that help the users to more easily navigate through the finding aids. Both Princeton University and Brigham Young University finding aids research show that users, in general, wish to have more visual cues and less text. However, it is understandable that finding aids lack visuals, since unlike museums that are extremely visual-based based on more object-oriented collections, archive collections generally are more on document-based materials side. Therefore, archivists tend to simply describe the items as certain types of documents such as dairy, scrapbooks, or newspaper without giving too much further descriptions. Although this might be sufficient in a way (the users can request further details if they are interested), a lot of time it is not enough, and the users might request them and find out they are not what they want, which waste both the users and the archivists’ time.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The paper will give an example of when the author is working with actor, musician, Theodore Bikel’s collections in UCLA Special Collections, the team encounter a lot of physical objects other than document-based materials. In one box, there are his various awards, certificates, and plaques from 1958 to 2015. Even though some of them are easy to imagine how they look physically, such as a piece of paper certificate or a wooden plaque, Bikel is also awarded two “keys” to Miami Beach, Florida. It is understandable that the users might be confused. What kinds of keys are they? Are they actual keys? What do they look like? If the archivists can provide images of them, it might be extremely helpful for the users (18).</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another aspect of lacking visuals is that users often complain that it is easy to get lost within the finding aids. Often, there is too much information going on, the users scroll and scroll than they are confused within all those levels of information and text. In Walton’s study, the participants complain that “It took me a long time to figure out how to sort items by date because I didn’t couldn’t see the arrow that was a clue for the feature...It was hidden” and “Clicking on the column header to reorder the items was tricky...It seems like you’d have to know about the button already in order to use it in that way”. Walton concludes those failures are due to the lack of visual cues than inappropriate navigational components (19).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is suggested that archival finding aids can look at how the museum catalogs present their collections. Although slightly different than finding aids in principles, museum catalogs are also the most important way for the users to engage with their collections. Likewise, museum catalogs also affected by the transition from analog to digital. In a report by the Getty Foundation states that they are going to advance their online catalogs and make them more discoverable and interactive: &nbsp;</div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Global audiences could engage with the latest&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">scholarship unfolding thousands of miles&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">away. Readers could zoom in on high-resolution images&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">of artworks and study them in dialogue with&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">conservation documentation. Video and audio clips could             bring the voice of the curator, conservator, or artist&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">into the space of the catalogue. Researchers could&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">take notes in the margins and store them for later use or               post comments for discussion with other scholars (20).&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div>All those functions might be too much for the archives, but it might also be a good direction for future archival finding aids that value more on visualizations and organizations. Although visuals still cannot represent the whole object in a clear way, such as its texture, it gives the users a clear sense of what the objects look like. They no longer need to imagine the objects from abstract text descriptions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides visuals, which might tend to be more static, if archives look for more interactive ability as technology becomes more and more advanced, it is also a preferable idea to look into the digital humanities field. Digital Humanists transform data and text into visualizations that not only allow the users to understand more easily, but through a series of interactions, such as maps or videos that make even deeper impressions on the users. In Anne Bahde’s article “Conceptual Data Visualization in Archival Finding Aids: Preliminary User Responses”, she attempts to consolidate the idea of data visualization with archival finding aids, then develop two types of new finding aids to conduct user-experience research. The research finds that users appreciate data visualizations which allow them to explore certain aspects of finding aids without reading a large chunk of text. For example, for the biography and historical notes, instead of a long text, users will be able to navigate through timelines to help them understand more easily “Beginner users were particularly enthusiastic about this tool, and many commented that they especially appreciated the ability to explore a life or a history in a non-textual way” (21). It might be a helpful way for finding aids to make more impressions on the users and provides an alternative way to rethink the formulations of finding aids.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides the lack of visualizations, the terminology is another aspect that users struggle upon according to the case studies. Unlike visualizations that might still be slightly subjective for different users, since people are likely to have different visual interpretations, the usage of terminologies is a concrete example that shows the discrepancy between the archivists and the users. It is easy to understand why this problem arises; when archivists create finding aids, it is natural for them to use their expertise to create them, thus add in professional jargons or terms that are familiar to them, yet not to the users. To avoid professional terms has been recognized in the archival field as one of the characteristics that makes the finding aids successful: “[Finding aids] are written in clear understandable language devoid of jargon” (22). This is not as difficult to change as the visualizations, since archivists only need to pay a little more attention to the terminologies, the problem can easily be solved.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is also suggested that archives can refer to museum apps that aim to use simple and straightforward vocabularies to represent their collections. Museum apps are particularly helpful in this respect because they are designed for users that do not have a lot of time: it is designed as on the go tools that accompany the users when they visit the museums. Therefore, the terms are often simple and easy to distinguish. Although finding aids are not something on the go in most of the time, the users do wish they can find the information they want as soon as possible without the impediment of terminologies. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides terminologies, finding aids’ structure is another problem that is being identified. In Brigham Young University finding aid example about the structure, it is actually closely related to how users generally dislike a large amount of text, since it often obscures what they really want to find and make the whole task daunting as they scroll through pages and pages of text. Thus, Brigham Young University purposes to make its interface clean and more user-friendly by suggesting that lower level details about the collections should be hidden to avoid large text, but the users can request them if they want to. Princeton University finding aid also suggests the same thing. However, even though this approach successfully solves the overwhelming text problem, the lack of lower-level descriptions might also cause problems: if a collection item sounds relevant, before requesting it, the users will like to know more about it, or else it is a waste of time for both the archivists and the users. Without lower-level descriptions, it might be hard to know. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although Describing Archive: A Content Standard (DACS), a series of rules that provide consistency for the archival materials, does not require item-level descriptions, as mentioned previously, it is still important to describe item-level for clarity. However, the problem is how to balance between clarity and avoid a large amount of text that confuses the users. Recently, Linked Data becomes an area that archives are eager to explore. The idea is to link the collections to primary sources that enrich the users’ experiences: “... these improvements can help overcome the well-known limitations of subject headings and imprecision of keyword searching, facilitate comparisons of historical data across space and time, and enable work across multiple collections” (23). It might be a good way for the finding aids to link to more detailed descriptions and the background of the items to give the users a better sense of understanding, yet at the same time successfully avoid making the interfaces too wordy. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As finding aids turn digital, finding aid software start to develop to make the archivists’ lives easier. Linked Data might potentially help make the software even more user-friendly. Currently, more and more archives begin to use an open source application called “ArchivesSpace”, a web-based archives information management system that makes creating finding aids simpler. Its mission statement is: “ArchivesSpace is a community of mutual support committed to helping cultural heritage organizations foster access to, and promote discovery of, historical records and primary sources through the provision of sustainable and highly functional software and tools” (24). Although ArchivesSpace is a convenient and fast tool to use, it can only generate finding aids that are in static PDF formats thus the users cannot navigate within. The paper suggests that the Linked Data idea can help ArchivesSpace creates more dynamic finding aids that give users a better sense of understanding regarding the collections, yet still keep the interfaces organized.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It might also be helpful for the archives to look into user-experience design fields, as digital finding aids become increasingly user-oriented. While there is more and more research on usability in terms of finding aids, the research generally does not use specific tools to examine usability, rather than just focus groups and surveys. These tools that are common for assessing usability in the user-experience field might be helpful for archives which have limited budgets and time to assess whether their finding aids are user-friendly by arranging group studies. Those tools include personas, which can help archives identify their targeted users and what kinds of challenges they might face with the archives’ finding aids, or user experience map that assess users’ utilization processes and their emotional reactions throughout the journey. Those tools might be helpful and effective for small-scale assessments in the archives. Steve Krug’s popular Human-Computer interaction book “Don’t Make Me Think” can also be of help as it describes how to make interfaces as easy and as direct as possible. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Limitations and Potential Solutions</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although the above changes from visuals to structurals might not be as complicated as it seems, it still poses problems for the archives to implement them. A lot of time it is not the archivists who do not want to change, rather, it is the institution as a whole that has a hard time. Two of the biggest problems that slow down changes are budget and the different mentalities between the archivists and the users. Even though such as adding the collection pictures on finding aids should be easy theoretically, it still requires the program to change in order to do so, which might cause difficulties for the archives. In general, archives have limited budget, and improving the usability of the finding aids might not be the priority for most of them. According to SAA, an archive:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>Refers to the permanently valuable records—such as&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">letters, reports, accounts, minute books, draft&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">and final manuscripts, and photographs—of people,                        businesses, and government. These records&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">are kept because they have continuing value to the                        creating agency and to other potential users. They are&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">the documentary evidence of past events. They&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">are the facts we use to interpret&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">and understand history (25).</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;</span></div><div>Thus under this general archive mission, it is hard to prioritize the budget towards improving the interfaces of finding aids, rather than protecting and allowing access for the actual materials. However, digital finding aids might have advantages to potentially solve this problem than analog finding aids due to the world-wide-web. The digital finding aids have much more potentials in inviting the collaborations between different archives and thus lower the cost. Archives are also able to share their findings and collaborate online that make the whole process much easier.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is more and more research on how to lower the budget, yet at the same time increases usability. In the article “Leveraging Encoded Archival Description for Access to Digital Content: A Cost and Usability Analysis”, DeRidder, Presnell, Walker propose a method that links digitized items directly to the web in order to speed the process up and lower the cost. This method omits the part in which archives need to create item-level metadata, which helps digitized a large amount of collection with much lower cost, and the users can connect with the collections more by getting more insightful information (26). This might be a practical method for other archives to look into and it ties to the previously mentioned Link Data that can keep the interfaces clean, yet still have sufficient information on the item level for the users and the overall cost will be lower.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides Link Data, collaborations between different archives on the web can also lower the cost and make finding aids more effective and helpful. In the article “Social Networks and Archival Context: From Project to Cooperative Archival Program”, SNAC “is a multiyear research and demonstration project that aims to address the longstanding research challenge of discovering, locating, and using distributed historical resources” (27). It attempts to change the way on how access points work, and turns it into more dynamic and richer information. Although SNAC still leaves a lot to be desired since it cannot calculate and organize all the data, it does provide insights on how finding aids can be, not just a static document: “SNAC now has as its objective the establishment of a sustainable archival cooperative program—representing the input of archivists, librarians, and scholars—who will collectively add to, edit, and maintain the vast data amount of data extracted and assembled in the first and second phases of the project” (28).</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides the budget problem in archives that make them have a hard time implementing more user-friendly finding aids, another problem to address is the different mentalities between the archivists and the users that cause difficulties. It is understandable that archivists, who work for the collections and understand the concepts, come into making finding aids with very different mindsets than the users. The two different positions make them focus on different things and they will present them in different ways. Even though more archivists start to put in mind the users’ needs, there still seems to be a long way to go. As archivist Richard J. Cox mentions from the results of multiple user studies that the archivists: “prepare their finding aids in a language and manner they are more comfortable with than are the researchers seeking to use archives, and they maintain the same content and format of the finding aids even as they have learned that researchers and their expectations are changing” (29). Another archivist, Elizabeth Yakel, also states: “even in the digital environment (such as in EAD), archivists treat the finding aid as a document genre, rather than as a set of discrete data elements” (30). The mentalities of the archivists might take times to change, yet from the increasing scholarly sources that show the focus on user-experiences increase significantly, it is confident to say that the archivists begin to understand more from the users’ viewpoints.</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion and Further Studies</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a good sign that more and more scholarly research focuses on how to improve finding aids by doing focus groups, which is one of the most effective ways to understand what the users really think about the finding aids’ usability. However, it will be insightful and helpful to see what kinds of things finding aids can achieve by bringing other fields into archives, such as the digital humanities field as mentioned in the Conceptual Data article. Museum catalogs and user-experience fields will also be very helpful in helping the archivists to develop better finding aids. The lack of interdisciplinary within the finding aids is something that the archival fields can improve upon further in the future. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through archival finding aids’ history and literature review, it is obvious that finding aids encounter a lot of changes from analog to digital forms both in terms of formats and how the archivists and the users view them. User-friendliness becomes a big part of what considered as a “good” finding aid. From the two case studies regarding Princeton University and Brigham Young University’s finding aids, the paper concludes the three most important aspects that finding aids should focus on now: visualizations, terminologies, and structures. The paper also suggests that bringing in other disciplines, such as the museum, digital humanity, and user-experience design fields will help archival finding aids become more well-rounded. The paper also recognizes the limitations on archives’ actual implementations to improve the digital finding aids due to budget and different mentalities between the archivists and the users. However, as stated earlier, the user-friendliness in archives is already becoming a huge topic, it will be exciting to see what archives is going to come up in the near future.&nbsp;</div></h3>
