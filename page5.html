            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-5 col-md-8"><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>I came into this MLIS program with a Bachelor degree in Film and Television, so initially, I aimed to pursue a career in film preservation. At the beginning of my first quarter, I toured various film studios to better understand the industry. I also took recommended classes for students interested in Media Archival Studies, such as Archives, Records, &amp; Memory and Introduction to Media Archiving &amp; Preservation. While I gained more insights in this particular area, I also wanted to explore classes that are more hands-on and focused more on technical aspects. I heard students from previous years recommended classes in informatics, since the classes generally involve working with real-life clients. However, informatics was a foreign term for me, but I decided to give it a try because when I enrolled in one of the core classes, Description &amp; Access, I was amazed by the fact that cataloging was more than feeding data into the machine; it is an important process that allows institutions and scholars to have better access to the resources.</p><p></p><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, the turning point in which I realized what institutions I was interested in working began with the internship fair in April, 2018. I came in with the hope that I would potentially intern in film studios to see how I felt about working in them. I talked to film studios such as HBO and NBC Universal. They all had interesting opportunities, yet unintentionally, I made contact with several museums, such as the Getty, LACMA, and the Japanese American Museum. I got particularly interested in the Wende Museum, a private museum that specialized in Cold War era collection. The recruiter emphasized that the internship would be very hands-on, since the museum was in the process of rehousing its collections. I had always been very interested in history and art, so I thought it would be a unique chance for me to combine my studies with my interests. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I began to intern in the Wende Museum in summer, 2018. While working in its Collection Department, I learned more about how to use databases, such as Mimsy XG to catalog and the preferred ways to rehouse various collections from textiles to household products. It was indeed an extremely hands-on experience that helped me combined theory with practice, and I found that I really enjoyed working in a museum environment. It was a refreshing feeling to be able to immerse myself in art and material cultures daily. The workplace was also very dynamic, which allowed me to observe how different departments such as educational and curatorial work together. It helped me bridge out my interests and allowed me to explore other areas in the museum fields that I might potentially be interested in. I was also fortunate enough to work briefly with a curator during the internship, and that was the first time I was introduced to curation. Even though I did not have sufficient knowledge in that area yet, I was fascinated by how dynamic and how much creativity a curator needed to put in. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fall quarter 2018, I started to intern in the Getty Conservation Institute. I worked in the information center to help them identify relevant literature and update databases. The internship taught and familiarized me with various cataloging systems, databases, and research tools, such as AATA, EndNote, and WorldCat. I also became more organized as I needed to create several spreadsheets to present my findings in structural ways to my supervisors. This opportunity reinforced my interest in working in the museums, and I got immense satisfaction knowing that I discovered new relevant literature that would be added to the databases. I also had a chance to connect with people from the special collection and attended workshops. Right now, I am certain that I would like to work in the museum fields, and working in information organization and catalogue in the museums will be my first step as a museum profession.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the start of the second quarter, I began to take classes both in informatics and media preservation. I soon realized that I was particularly interested in the interactions between users and technologies. The major paper I chose was from Archival Description &amp; Access course, which I discussed how to design more user-friendly archival finding aids. The topic is highly related to my portfolio topic on how to improve museum virtual reality tours’ discoverability and accessibility online. In the UX Design course, my group and I examined museum apps from around the globe and analyze their pros and cons in order to develop an app prototype for Museo Egizio in Turin. These projects combined with the knowledge I gained from enrolling in Human and Computer Interaction made me interested in working with databases and cataloging, since I believed having knowledge on how behind-the-scene operates first could guide me into understanding more on how to help the external users. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since now I realize that my real interest is working in the museum fields, especially in the art museums, I begin to research into relative disciplines, while enroll in classes that I know will be the most relevant, such as Issues &amp; Problems in Preservation of Heritage Materials and Digital Humanities, as well as informatics classes, such as Subject Cataloging and Data Curation that would further advance my skills in cataloging. At the same time, I applied for internships and volunteer opportunities in various museums in hope to understand the field more. As I began to learn more about myself, I also came to realize that I would potentially want a dynamic career, so I am also considering to go on to curatorial and conservational aspects of the museums, and I am fortunate to branch out by interning in Fowler Museum’s conservation department, which I learned to write condition and treatment reports, as well as basic conservation skills. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, my goal is to work or intern in the museum information or collection department on information management, with expanding to curation or conservation in mind. I also joined SAA and went to library tours hosted by SLA in hope to expand my horizon; I plan on going to SAA Conference this year. I know I will need to build up more experiences and knowledge before I can enter into either of those disciplines, since there are significant amounts of requirements, such as art history, general chemistry knowledge, and fieldworks. I hope to explore and take classes on relevant subjects as my future professional development. With the knowledge in information science, and either curation or conservation, I hope I will be able to build a more exciting and fulfilling career in the museum field.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><p></p></div>
