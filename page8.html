                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">Abstract: Archive of Our Own (AO3) is a digital archive storing a variety of fanworks. Established in 2007, it is <br>immensely popular, since it gives the users the absolute freedom of either creating or reading fanworks. However, upon closer inspection, the users do not have as much control over the archive as they initially believe. AO3’s lack of accountability and appraisal process arise a lot of controversies, such as ethical issues regarding Real People fictions (RPF) and copyright. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Introduction</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fan culture is not exactly a new phenomenon that only emerges in recent years. Before the widespread of the Internet, fans with different interests, such as in sports, movies, television shows, and music, have already come together from around the world, forming groups called ‘fandom’, and create fanworks for their favorite subjects and characters. With the rise of the Internet, digital archives dedicated to preserve and store fanworks begin to emerge. This paper is going to use one of the most popular and most recent fanwork digital archives ‘Archive of Our Own’ (AO3) as a case study to illustrate its controversies and in some aspects, the problems of digital archives in general.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AO3’s primary mission is to ‘serve the interests of fans by providing access to and preserving the history of fanworks and fan culture in its myriad forms’ (1). Even though AO3 seems to be designed and oriented solely for fans (the users), several uncertain aspects in this archive actually form an ‘invisible’ force that takes control of the users. On the surface, the users have false assumptions that they have full control over the archive, since they can upload and browse whatever they desire, yet they are not as free as they believe. The reasons lie within that AO3 does not have clear accountability and the operations behind it is not transparent to the users; it has no appraisal process; the preservation destination is unclear, and there are also copyright issues regarding fanworks.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Background</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AO3 is created in 2007 by a fan-established organization called The Organization for Transformative Works (OTW). It is nonprofit and noncommercial, so it relies on the users’ donations for operations. Besides providing access and storage for fanworks, AO3 also devotes its effort to defending fanworks ‘from commercial exploitation and legal challenge’(2). A fan can choose to become the user by simply setting up an account consists of an email address, a password, and a username (pen name). Fans not wanting to register are still able to access fanworks; the only difference is that they cannot post their own works or leave comments. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without viewing AO3 critically, it is easy to assume that the users really are in full control. First and foremost, it is open to everyone around the world. In fact, one of the most prominent archival practices is accessibility, and in theory, every single person should be granted access to archives. Yet in reality, there are a lot of restrictions posted either by governments or institutions. Some require researchers to write permission letters way in advance, and some only allow access to the people who hold citizenships in certain countries (3). None of these restrictions exist in AO3. No matter where or who the users are, they are free to access all the contents on it as long as they have Internet connections. Therefore, it is not surprising to believe that AO3 gives the users full control.</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only do the users have free access to any contents they want on AO3, they also do not need to fear that the archive will take down their works without notifying them. This feature is largely in response to another fanwork digital archive, Fanfiction.net. It is created in 1998, and is one of the largest and most popular fanfiction archives in the world. However, as the demand increases, Fanfiction.net decides to profit by employing advertisements, causing certain fanworks being banned or delete from the site, because of this incident, a lot of users have lost their works permanently (4). With that in mind, the AO3 users have confidence in believing that they are still in control over their own works even after they post them on the website.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aside from these two features, AO3 is also an archive that requires no fee and has no advertisements. Unlike the majority of the fandom social media, such as Fanfiction.net, Tumblr, and LiveJournal, which either imposes an annual fee or has advertisements, AO3 is very clear on making no profit from it. For the AO3 users, the freedom to access and post any contents they want with no fee and no fear of them being taken down are enough for them to believe that this is truly an archive for the users.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Trust, Accountability, and Transparency in AO3</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since in the eyes of the users, AO3 is so free of intervention; it is easy to fail to consider what kind of organization is in charge of this archive, and how the organization structures. With physical archives, there is clear-cut information on which organizations are in charge and how they operate. For example, The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is a governmental agency that maintains United States government’s documents, records, and makes them available to the public. This is similar to the community archives that exist in physical forms, such as ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives, which is maintained by the University of Southern California and preserves records related to the LGBTQ society. Both of these examples have clear agencies as to who is in charge, and the public can easily understand their missions and duties by browsing through their respective websites or visit the archives in person.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, it is unclear what kind of organization is in charge of the digital archive AO3. The only thing users know about is that it belongs to an organization called ‘The Organization for Transformative Works’ (OTW), and is established by fans in 2007. It lists a few major projects that it is currently working on, such as shelters at risk fanworks, defends fanworks from legal prosecutions, and has peer-reviewed scholarly journals aim to promote scholarship on fanworks and practices (5). Unlike NARA or ONE, it is completely unclear as to whom OTW answers to: Is it an independent agency? Or does it have a parent organization? What sort of fanworks does it store, and who exactly are those ‘fans’ that established the organization?</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In physical archives, it is also easier to find the archivists that are responsible for them. From the NARA website, there is a list of archivists for people who are interested in contacting them. On ONE’s website, there is an even more detailed list of archivists’ information. It has their names, titles, and email addresses that can give people a clear sense as to who are the archivists that are responsible for the materials and where they can express their questions as well as concerns.&nbsp;</div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compare to NARA and ONE, the archivists who are responsible for AO3 are barely visible. The people working for AO3 can be roughly categorized into two: ‘volunteer’ and ‘staff’. ‘Volunteer’ can be anyone who is over 13 years old; ‘staff’ is those working on the OTW committee; their works often require more time commitment than volunteers (6). There is a list of short biographies of each staff member, yet not only do they have no contact information, a lot of them represent themselves using pen names instead of their actual names. This not only causes a lot of doubts about the identities of those staff members, but also start the question on how trust-worthy is AO3 and its organization OTW.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is often not enough to simply list the job title of an archivist. To make the organizations more transparent and trustworthy to the people, they will also list out the duties of the archivists. On the website of NARA, it has detailed list on the duties of different kinds of archivists, such as the duties of archives specialists and archives technicians, or different fields of works that contribute into this, such as conservators and photographers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, the responsibilities of the archivists in AO3 are much vaguer. The volunteers’ duties include coders, testers, and translators for the webpage guidelines and Q&amp;A. But when there are no openings, the users are unlikely to find more details on those job descriptions. It is similar to the staff’s job descriptions. AO3 only has a vague statement saying that the staff is required to serve on the board committee, yet there is no further information after that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without knowing what kind of an organization is in charge of AO3, it is hard for the users to place trust on it, as archivist and record manager Geoffry Yeo argues about the importance of an institution’s reputation: “… the professional archivist and the archival institution still have key roles to play in securing trust… we trust the reputation of an established name, so when we come to assess statements about the provenance or context of records and archives we may be more likely to trust those made by people or institutions we perceive as reputable and competent” (7). Taking off trust in AO3, the users will likely feel that a large part of their controls over the archive is gone, since they have no idea how the organization operates and what sort of a move it will take next.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trust is built on accountability and transparency. To establish that, the identities and responsibilities of the archivists need to be clear, so the users will know who take the responsibilities and where to seek answers when they have concerns. In Verne Harris and Christopher Merrett’s book Towards a Culture of Transparency, they analyze the responsibilities of archivists: “… in everything they [archivists] do- the records they choose to preserve, how they arrange them, describe them- and make them available- archivists are active shapers of social memory, and they in turn are positioned within, and are shaped by, the larger forces that contest the terrain of social memory” (8). Even though AO3 seems to be a ‘self-serve’ archive to the users, the archivists should still take the final responsibilities towards social memory- the fan culture, in order to show AO3’s accountability and trustworthiness. Yet this is not the case, the users often have problems when confronting more controversial contents within fandoms and without knowing where they can turn to.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the most notable controversies exists in the fandom world is the ‘Real People Fictions’ (RPF). It is actually a popular genre that has more than 10 thousand works with AO3. RPF is fanworks that use celebrities’ real names and pair them with other celebrities. There is an ongoing debate as to whether this should be allowed or not. Some strongly against this idea as Nightrunner author Lynn Flewelling said: “Here’s my opinion on people writing sexually oriented fanfiction about real people. It’s WRONG, CREEPY, VERY EXTREMELY ICKY, and should be ILLEGAL.” (9) Yet on the other side, there are people arguing that celebrities most likely do not expect any sort of privacy when they enter public lives, and even though the names are real, within fanfiction world, it is never about ‘real’ event, or in this case, ‘real’ people.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, the real problem in AO3 with RPF is not the debate of for or against this genre, rather, it is the uncertainty of who should take the responsibility if ever any kinds of violations arise. Regarding RPF, here is AO3’s policy: “Writing RPF (real-person fiction) never constitutes harassment in and of itself. However, content that advocates specific, real harmful actions towards real people are not allowed.” (10) Despite having this policy, who should be responsible if some users do post something harmful? Should the original writers be the one since they write them? Or should AO3 be responsible, since it is the one that allows people to post this sort of genre without censorship? Without clear-cut guidelines, the same problem is likely to come up over and over again for AO3. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even if AO3 attempt to be accountable to the contents by adding filters, it is unlikely for it to succeed. All of the fanworks are written under pen names, and AO3 also allows people to post stories anonymously. AO3 does have a feature called ‘Report Abuse’, which users can submit contents they believe violate certain codes. It does not have a clear definition as to what cause as ‘abuse’. The users can only assume the usual regarding creative works, such violations of copyright, or suspected plagiarism. There is not a single mention regarding moral and ethical issues within fanworks. Moreover, the report abuse page is monitored by volunteers. It is doubtful whether AO3 has a clear guideline or principles that volunteers can base on, since this kind of report seems to be highly subjective from person to person.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Appraisal and AO3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only does AO3’s trustworthiness is in a questionable state, the lack of appraisal in the digital archive also causes some major problems. Appraisal, as American archivist F. Gerald Ham states: “Our most important and intellectually demanding task as archivists is to make an informed selection of information that will provide the future with a representative record of human experience in our time…” (11) Simply put, appraisal is an archival process, in which archivists conduct selections of records. In their opinions, the chosen records represent a period, a group of individual, or a part of a culture.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some might question the purpose of appraisal, since it sounds easier to preserve every single record. From a practical point of view, appraisal helps reduce the growing amount of records. Initially, its primary purpose is to decrease the records used by the registry system, since there are limited spaces for storage. As the appraisal practice becomes more mature, it takes on a further mission to ensure that the selections will adequately represent the underrepresented. Moreover, the reason for eliminating part of the records can also protect individuals’ privacies due to the growing of unauthorized and illegal access (12).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For AO3, there is absolutely no appraisal process. Its only mission is to ‘protect all fanworks’, and that is exactly what it does. As long as the user has successfully registered, he or she can post anything on the website. It can be a one-sentence work, or a novel-length story; it can be a fanvideo, a piece of fanart, or a podfic. Not a single work will go through appraisal process in AO3 to determine which should stay and which should be destroyed. Even though there are indeed some debates among the scholars arguing that whether digital archives have the need for appraisal: “… whether it is fruitful to continue to attempt appraisal, given the extraordinary volume of digital documentation being created today, and the profoundly networked nature of organizational and personal activities in the digital realm that makes it difficult to identify points of decision-making or to establish institutional boundaries around records.” (13) However, regardless of how the debate goes, the lack of appraisal in AO3 already comes up with a lot of problems. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since there is no appraisal process, the users on AO3 are free to put down anything they like, that includes the freedom to categorize their works as they wish. There are three ‘tags’ that the users need to fill in in order to successfully upload their works. The first one is ‘Rating’, which consist of four types from ‘General Audience’ to ‘Explicit’; ‘Archive Warnings’, which has six categories, such as ‘No Archive Warnings Apply’ or ‘Graphic Depiction of Violence’; the last one is which ‘Fandom’ does the work belongs to. One can argue that this is supposed to act as a ‘rough’ appraisal, since other users can search the stories they are interested in according to these categories. However, besides ‘Fandom’, both ‘Rating’ and ‘Archival Warnings’ consist of options called ‘Not Rated’ and ‘[Creator] Choose Not to Use Archival Warnings’. The reasons for choosing not to use these tags varied from person to person, yet by providing ‘full control’ for the users that create fanworks, AO3 undeniably takes some rights away from the majority of other users, the readers. The same problem emerges in the ‘Additional Tags’ section, which the users (creators) can put in everything they like, even if some of those tags hardly related to their stories at all. Both of these show that, without AO3 doing any appraisal works, such as applying a standard for vocabularies and selections, the users (readers) will have a hard time trying to navigate the website and are likely to see something that they do not wish to see. In this aspect, AO3 does allow the users to have full control, yet only the creators, not the readers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To apply appraisal to the archive, one of the most important factors is to preserve what deem as ‘valuable’ and discard all the other records that will have little value over the years. Those remaining records are supposed to be valuable since they represent the essence of a crucial part of history or culture. Therefore, when AO3 does not apply appraisal process claiming it wants to preserve all the fanworks, does that mean every piece of fanwork is equally valuable? Without proper filter and selection, how will people view certain aspects of fan culture from ten years or even more? Will the definition change for fan culture when all the fanworks are preserved for ten or more years? Those are questions that are unlikely to get answers now, yet for AO3, or any other digital archives, having no appraisal process does not mean it gives users more control, rather it creates a lot of inconceivable problems. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Preservation and Copyrights Issue &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides the lack of accountability and appraisal, preservation and copyright issue are also something AO3 should consider. First of all, what database does AO3 use to store its data? In the essay “Digital Preservation: A Time Bomb for Digital Library”, Margaret Hedstrom defines her ideal digital archive: “Ideally, storage media will have a long life expectancy, a high degree of disaster resistance, sufficient durability to withstand regular use, and very large storage capacities… Storage space requirements will be minimal and not demand highly sensitive environmental controls” (14). Those are important factors to form a complete and safe digital archive, yet in reality, this is often not the case. In AO3, the users have no knowledge of its storage system, and have no idea as to where their fanworks will go once they hit the “post” button. This is highly problematic, since without knowing the basics of AO3’s digital storage system, the users will have a hard time trusting the archive, because there is a crucial and important territory unknown to them that forces them to realize that perhaps the users are not as in control of the fanworks and the archive as much as they like to believe. </span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only do the users have no idea where AO3 store their fanworks, there is also no indication in regard to space limitation. Unlike physical archives where people can see that there is an obvious space limitation, digital archives also have the same problem. AO3 never mentions about its storage limit or whether it is ever at risk of running out of space. To make it clear, digital storage requires money and AO3 does ask for users’ donations from time to time. However, it never specifies how exactly do they budget this money. Therefore, for the users, AO3 still has the ultimate control over the archive. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides not knowing the storage limitation, there are also copyright issues in AO3. Normally, the work belongs to the creator as long as there is no problem in regard to plagiarism. However, there is one of the functions on AO3 called ‘Orphaning’. This function is for the users who want to cut off any association with their particular fanworks, yet do not wish to remove them forever from the archive. The work will then link to AO3’s special account called ‘orphan_account’, where the original creator will no longer have control over it. It is interesting to see that AO3 strongly states that this is a permanent decision, so the creator cannot choose to re-associate with this work anymore. It does say that the work will be maintained by the archive, yet the problem still exists: does it now means that that particular work in orphan_account’s copyright belongs to AO3 or does it become open for free use among the public? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is also another problematic aspect in AO3 that makes the users extra vulnerable, which is that there is always a running risk that AO3 will shut down one day. It is no guarantee that AO3 will be active forever. What if AO3 does close down one day, who will be responsible for all the fanworks? Will the creators and the users be able to retrieve their works and accounts? Those are all the uncertain factors that AO3 does not put into their statement clearly. Therefore, at first glance, it looks like the users are in control of a lot of aspects in AO3, but in fact, they are powerless in a lot of situations that are solely controlled by the archive.</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At first glance, AO3 seems to be a digital archive that is controlled by the users, since they have the freedom to upload any kinds of fanworks without fear of being banned or deleted. It also requires no fee to access AO3 and there are no advertisements on the website. With those reasons in mind, the users often overlook the fact that they are actually being controlled by AO3 and are not as free as they believe. Without clear background information on OTW, the organization that is in charge of AO3, the users have a hard time trusting the organization and cause them to question the archive’s accountability and transparency. AO3 also lacks any appraisal processes, so the problems such as tagging and representative of the records’ value arise; last but not least, the copyright issue is also a major problem in AO3.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though there are a lot of problems that come up as the paper explore AO3 further, that does not mean it is a website that people should avoid using. In fact, it is one of the more user-friendly sites for fanworks creators and readers. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness that there are a lot of complications behind the archive, and as a matter of fact, digital archives as a whole. To understand deeper about the problems, the users will be able to know how to protect their rights more. There are still a lot of unresolved problems regarding AO3, yet from the current condition, the digital archive seems to still be running strong, attracting thousands of visitors from around the world to browse this website daily.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></h3>
