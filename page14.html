                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this diverse society, people gather together to form a variety of communities. They may be bound by similar locations, values, professions, cultures, or perhaps, more than one of those elements combined. Naturally, some communities are more powerful than the others; this may due to the fact that they have better access to resources and advantages on locations. Various scholars have identified the inequality between communities and try to come up with solutions. Nevertheless, a lot of their essays tend to generalize communities into two simple types: the one with power (either more resourceful or situates in a better location) and the one without. They fail to address the fact that communities are constructed under very complicated situations, and there will be plenty of communities in-between that do not fit into the two simple categories; they are combinations of different characteristics that cannot be generalized and define as powerful or powerless.&nbsp;<br><br><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This paper argues that without addressing the middle area between the extreme ends of communities, it is hard to see the complete picture of how communities operate in the society. First of all, to divide the communities up simply by one element will never unveil thoroughly the cause of conflicts among different communities. Secondly, different communities will have different definitions on how to present themselves and what elements are deemed as powerful or not. Thirdly, generalizing the communities will dismiss the voices and efforts of what traditionally viewed as less powerful communities, which also try to raise awareness, even though it is not as visible to others. Last but not least, generalization also means to ignore the internal struggles and power structures within each community. This will put the already less powerful group of people in the same community in an even more disadvantaged position. These kinds of problems occur not only externally between communities but also internally within communities if one simply divides them into two types. Without addressing the bigger issues, one will never be able to fill in the gap in order to achieve true equality across different communities.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To explore this topic further, this paper will analyze essays and articles such as Jessica Seddon Wallack and Ramesh Srinivasan’s “Local-Global: Reconciling Mismatched Ontologies in Development Information Systems”, Faye Ginsberg’s “Rethinking the Digital Age”, Michael J. Thompson’s review on David Harvey’s book A Brief History of Neoliberalism, Sarah T. Roberts’ “Social Media’s Silent Filter”, and Katie Shilton and Ramesh Srinivasan’s “Participatory Appraisal and Arrangement for Multicultural Archival Collections”. All of them have very detailed arguments on what consists of powerful or powerless communities, and how the discrepancies make them in conflict with each other. However, their arguments or the examples they give all generalize the communities and divide them up into two types, thus fail to address the grey areas in between.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides the counterexamples above, this paper will also give examples from essays and articles that do support the notion that it is not enough to divide the communities into two types. These include Ginsburg’s arguments against the example she gives in “Rethinking the Digital Age”, Srinivasan’s critiques on Paulo Freire’s theory in his essay “Where Information Society and Community Voice Intersect”, James P. Spradley’s “The Ethnographic Interview”, and Achille Mbembe’s “The Digital Age Erases the Divide Between Humans and Objects”. All four of them address the multiple sides of the communities and do not generalize, thus present a more well-rounded picture of the true nature of communities.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reoccurring example this paper is going to use to counter and illustrate the arguments in the essays and articles is the fandom community. Fandom, as defined by the Oxford Dictionaries: “The fans of a particular person, team, fictional series, etc. regarded collectively as a community or subculture” (Oxford Dictionaries). Fandom’s structure is loose and often mystical, since it is not strictly bound by locations, professions, values, or resources. It demonstrates that it is not enough to simply categorize communities into two types, but consider the possibilities in between, since communities’ structures are complex and have multiple layers. To make the examples more concrete, this paper will use one of the popular fandoms, Merlin, a BBC fantasy TV show, which runs from 2008 to 2012, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E., a 60s spy show. </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Communities are often being divided into two opposite types in a lot of research papers. The danger of this approach is that dismissing the middle ground will simplify the whole situation, and thus overlook a lot of important factors that cause mismatches between communities. To simplify the situation might allow easier understandings for the readers, but it is not enough to get the essence of the dynamics between communities. In Wallack and Srinivasan’s essay “Local-Global: Reconciling Mismatched Ontologies in Development Information Systems”, they divide the communities up into two types: local and state communities. They believe that the different ontologies in which these two communities employed is the key to their mismatches, and the reason for different ontologies is because of their different locations. However, to simply group the communities into two types, it might be able to solve the bigger issue at first glance, but fail to consider the communities that do not lie within these two types will never be able to solve the conflicts between the communities.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The example Wallack and Srinivasan use is the “waterlogging” problem that occurs in Karnataka, India. The local community refers to Karnataka, and the authors define the state community as “subnational, national, and international governing institutions” (Wallack and Srinivasan 1). They conclude that it is because of how local and state have different ontologies, even though both of them want to solve the same problem, they only create mismatches. It may make sense to group the communities into two types based on their locations, since this seems to be the major difference. However, to do this is to ignore other factors that build up the communities, such as resources, communications or other elements that might cause the mismatches. Therefore, this approach is not enough to completely solve the mismatches due to the fact that other important elements in communities do not being taken into considerations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fandom community is a suitable example to show that communities cannot simply be divided into local or state. To understand more about fandom, one needs to consider elements more than locations. It is impossible to divide fandom up based on locations, since fandom, via mostly on social media, consists of people who live in metropolitan, rural areas, and all around the world. To categorize fandom based on locations, it undeniably puts too much attention on the locations and overlooks how fandom’s contributions consist of a broad range of people around the world. In the Merlin fandom, the fans come from different states, different countries, and different continents. The social media and websites that build up the Merlin fandom are impossible to be placed in either state or local as categorized in Wallack and Srinivasan’s the essay.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some may argue that the waterlogging example is quite different than the fandom that relies heavily on the Internet and social media for its formation. However, since the impacts of the Internet does not restrain to fandom, it also has huge effects on everything else. Therefore, due to technology, the information spreads out fast and wild, the line between local and state is not so clear-cut like the pre-Internet era. The boundary between locations becomes blurry. If one becomes fixated by looking for differences only through locations, that will fail to address the communities in the middle and cause the people to forget what are the other elements that influence the power dynamics in the society, thus will not be able to identify the bigger issues that cause the mismatches between communities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides it is problematic to divide communities up into local and state, the internal elements that consist within these communities are not so subtle that they belong to only one specific type: “Communities may in fact form and self-define around shared ontologies, constructed and reconstructed fluidly through shared social and cultural activities and the ever-changing lived experiences of their members” (Wallack and Srinivasan 1). As the essay argues, communities are formed by ever-changing elements that are not easy to define and categorize. While if this is true, it seems even more impossible to simply divide communities up based on their locations. They should be constantly changing and not be bound by any single one of the elements. Even though to divide up communities into local and state is easier to illustrate the waterlogging example in India, it fails to consider that there are so many characteristics within a community that cannot be generalized into broader categories.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Achille Mbembe, in his article, “The Digital Age Erases the Divide Between Humans and Objects”, acknowledges that none of the characteristics are static, no matter whether it is object or personhood: “Personhood was therefore not a matter of ontology, it’s multiplicity of vital beings” (Mbembe). Therefore, it is simply not enough to categorize communities into two categories, by doing so, the action ignores the ever-changing elements that build up the community. Without considering other types of elements, the conclusion will be faulty and inaccurate, because it </div><div>only focuses on one part.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reflect on the previous definition of the elements consist of a community, fandom is an appropriate example to illustrate that the elements that consist it are ever-changing and fluidly reflect on the social activities around it. Even though fandom’s history can be traced back to the analog era, it becomes better known when the Internet begins to become popular. It brings people from all over the places together and it changes rapidly, since the active level of fandom depends on a lot of outside elements. If there are new activities emerge, they may awake the long-dormant old fandom, or a fandom might get fewer activities after the show ends. For example, if there are new movies about Merlin, the Arthurian Legend in general, or the main actors in the show have new films coming up, the Merlin fandom will become more active again through the sharing of videos and photos via social media. Thus, fandom, like all the moving and breathing communities, cannot be simply categorized into two, since internally, the elements are already not stable, but ever-changing according to the activities of the society.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To simplified and categorize the communities into two types, local and state, is not a good way to look at the society as a whole. It might be an easy and efficient way if the problems mainly caused by different locations. However, this method ignores a lot of elements that shape the communities and the society. First of all, it is not enough to categorize the communities into local and state; this action ignores a lot of factors that exist in the middle of these two types of communities. Second, it is almost impossible to even categorize communities based on locations, since the elements that consist of those communities are changing and fluid as the fandom example illustrates. It might be easier to show the problems by dividing up the communities, but one must remember the danger of generalizing and remember to view the bigger picture or else will fail to see the core problems.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides categorizing communities into local and state, which ignores the fact that there are other communities that cannot be categorized into them, divide the communities up into one with resources and one without is also insufficient. The term “Digital Divide” becomes popular through the arrival of the digital age. It describes the unequal access to resources and technology across the globe (Ginsburg). Scholars often use this term to describe the situation in which some communities have less power than the others, and they seek to solve this situation by giving those less powerful communities more resources and believe that it will solve the problem of inequality.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Ginsburg’s essay “Rethinking the Digital Age”, she discusses the debate rises after the United Nation proposes a funding program called “Digital Solidarity Fund” that aims to promote equal access and include the previous being excluded people into the field of technology (Ginsburg 1). Although the intention of this program is positive, it simplifies the complex situation into splitting the communities up into two types: the one which has access to technology and the one without. Therefore, they conclude that, as long as those underprivileged communities have the same resources, the inequality between the communities will disappear. This is a dangerous approach, since it is impossible to know how much resources are enough to achieve equality. By simply divide up the communities, the program overlooks the fact that communities are complex beings, there are so many communities across, thus, it is impossible to divide them up according to their resources.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Doubtful of the simple approach on how the United Nation believes this program will solve inequality between communities by simply distributing more resources to the less powerful communities, Ginsburg, as well as other critics share their concerns:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even as it wants to call well-intentioned concern to &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such inequities,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">the term nonetheless invokes</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; neo-developmentalist language that&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">assumes less</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; privileged&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">cultural enclaves with little or no access&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to digital resources- from the South Bronx to the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; global South-&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">are simply waiting, endlessly,</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to catch up to the privileged West. (5)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Indeed, it is not a simple answer as if this community does not have this type of resource, giving them will automatically make them become equal to the other powerful communities. This method fails to consider the middle area, where communities are not so easily been seen as resourceful or not. The elements of communities are intertwined and complicated. By dividing the communities up into two simple types, it is impossible to achieve equality, because it disregards the other elements that come into play. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; James P. Spradley’s book <em>The Ethnographic Interview</em> provides a good counterexample that illustrates how it is not enough to simply divide the communities into two types based on resources. It is common for one to determine what others need according to one’s own point of view, but that is not necessarily accurate, since this might not be what they really need, but what others think they need. After years of fieldworks, Spradley understands that it is not enough to simply write down what other groups say, but to note down the precise languages the groups use. To do this is to preserve the essence of the particular group and avoid over-generalizing. Therefore, it is not enough to simply give more resources to the communities that are traditionally thought as lacking, rather, it is important to understand each of their individualities in order to properly understand and collaborate with them.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fandom community is one of the many examples that shows communities cannot be simply divided up into one with resources and the one without. Fandom’s resources vary, but from a technological standpoint, no matter whether it is a big fandom with a lot of people in it or a small fandom consists of only a few, they have equal resources as long as the members have Internet connections. Even for members with limited Internet connections, they are still able to connect with other members in the fandom, due to physical fanarts or flyers call for members to meet in real life. For example, there are congregations around the world for the Merlin fandom, where fans can meet physically and discuss their obsessions. Therefore, fandom community cannot be put in either side. It does not categorize as resourceful, but it is definitely not without resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Externally, communities cannot be divided up into two types; it is the same internally within a community. For the United Nation program, they assume that more resources mean more power, and that will be able to achieve equality among communities as long as they distribute the resources equally. They do not consider community’s individuality, that each community may have different definitions for resources and how they utilize them will cause different results.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In regard to the program, some within the community believe that the opportunity to access to more resources will indeed empower the communities as Tuscarora artist, scholar Jolene Rickard expresses: “That time has come… There is no doubt that First Nation People are wired and ready to surf and chat. It seems like a distant memory when the tone of discussion about computers, interactivity, and aboriginal people was filled with Prophetic caution” (Ginsburg 1-2). However, others are not so certain. Some question who is in charge of these resources and who has the rights to the knowledge. Regional manager of the Outback Digital Network, Alopi Latukefu questions: “The issue that needs to be raised before any questions of indigenous usage of the Internet is: whose information infrastructure or “info-structure” determines what is valued in an economy- whether in the local community or the greater global community which they are limited to?” (Ginsburg 2) There are yet another that thinks that open up to the resources given by others will eventually make them economical and lose their original self (Ginsburg 2). Every community has its own definitions and thoughts on the resources. Therefore, it is impossible to even determine the impacts resources have within a community. It does not act as an empowerment to the communities if the approach does not even consider the individualities within each community.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Similar to the above communities, fandom community cannot simply be defined as resourceful or not resourceful. First of all, the definition of resource in the fandom is unclear. Is it according to the number of fans? This might be the preferable way to say that this fandom has more resources, since more members mean more productions in regard to fan-related materials. However, fewer people in a fandom does not mean the fandom is not resourceful, in opposite, they might have other alternate ways to make up for this. For example, compared to the Merlin fandom, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. fandom is much smaller, due to its age. Even though it has fewer fanfictions and fanarts, the members in the fandom are much closer than other larger fandoms. Resourceful or not, this is a broad term to determine and define a fandom community; it fails to recognize the individuality and uniqueness of each community.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, it is obvious to see that it is not enough to categorize communities into two simple categories: the one with resources and the one without. Externally, it is impossible to divide communities up by only looking at their resources; internally, the definitions of resources are different within each community. To generalize and overlook the fact the resources have different meanings in each community, it fails to allow them to present themselves in the way they desire, but view them through only one bias lens. It is not enough to imagine what the other communities need, because that often ends up the opposite of what the program creators want to achieve initially, as Ginsburg argues: “Rather than imagining that we know the answers, clearly, we need to keep listening to the large percentage of the earth’s population that is on the unwired side of the so-called digital divide (9).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is natural to think that with resources come influences. A community with more resources will be more influential than the others. Even though this may be true, to only consider this factor and ignore the other elements in the communities will only end up with a generalized and unfair conclusion. In Thompson’s review of David Harvey’s book A Brief History of Neoliberalism, Harvey voices his concern regarding “region inequality”. He states that coastal cities are often richer than inland due to the advantage of locations and resources, with that it comes more influences. Although this is a reasonable assumption, the fact that he divides up communities into two types: coastal and inland, is inadequate. This assumption assumes that in the world, there are only two types of societies, but he forgets to mention the roles of the communities that are in-between coastal cities and inland. By excluding them, he disregards the influences the in-between communities have towards both the coastal cities and inland. Without considering them, it is hard to see the complete picture of how coastal cities and inland really work.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like the clear division of coastal cities and inland in David Harvey’s book, Sarah T. Roberts’ article “Social Media Filter” also only looks at communities’ influential degree by dividing them up into two types: the commercial content moderations (CCM) workers and the team above them. Although this is a valid assumption that the higher up the people are in the companies, the more influences they have. However, the problem here is that the article disregards that these are not the only parts of the companies that have influences. By dividing them up, the article assumes that the team above the CCM workers has influences and the CCM workers do not; it ignores the fact that the power structures in companies are not so clear-cut. Who has power and who has not is not clear, rather, it is intertwined in companies. Moreover, the article states that the operation within the company is not transparent, therefore, it is even harder to divide up into groups and state clearly that one has more influences over the other.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fandom community is a good way to illustrate that both the above articles forget to address the communities in the middle that are not exactly influential but also are not completely without influences. At first glance, fandom seems to have no influences towards the entertainment industry whatsoever, since it is just a community form by people who have the same interest in certain movies or books. However, fandom actually has influences over the industry, though it might not be visible at the first glance. As the entertainment industry tries to level up their revenues, they will start searching for what their viewers like, so fandom provides a very good way for them to understand what the viewers want most. Though this might not be completely effective, fandom creates arts, videos, and some also write emails and letters to the companies to express their thoughts on certain programs. None of this seems very visible from the outside, but fandom does have certain influences towards the industry. Therefore, to only divide the communities up into two types, it fails to see that a community can have influences in a lot of ways. It is not always so clear-cut, and it certainly misses a lot of elements if one simply divides communities up into one with influences and one without.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To categorize communities into one with influence and one without, not only fails to consider the big picture of how the in-between communities work, but also generalize the community as a whole, which assumes that it has equal influences internally. The problem is that even within a community, there are bound to have members that have more influences over others. Fail to address this part will result in not seeing the complete picture of a community, and dismiss the smaller voices within it. In the case of the CCM workers, even though they generally have less power than the team above them, to say that all the CCM workers have the same influences are not accurate. In the article when Roberts interviews one of the workers to better understand his working conditions, this worker undeniably has more power compared to his colleagues. Since his words will be carried out in a magazine allowing the public to know more about the CCM workers’ situations. In this case, it is inappropriate to say that all the people in a group have equal influences, because this will ignore the influences and efforts individuals have within a community, and overlook the fact that within it, not all of the members are the same.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fandom illustrates this example of unequal influences within a community perfectly. In a fandom, not all the members have equal influences. Some of them undeniably have louder voices than the others. One of the popular elements in a fandom is “the ship”, where fans pair two or more characters together. In the usual case, there will be more than one ship per show, though one will be predominant and more popular. In this case, it will have more influences over the others, and perhaps influences the industry into noticing what the majority of the audience wants to see. For example, in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. fandom, the Russian spy, Illya Kuryakin, initially only has a small role, but he becomes very popular after his first appearance; the audience wants to see more of him and his interactions with the main character, the American spy, Napoleon Solo. There are other pairings within the fandom which pair the two main characters with other spies, but they are generally less popular. Therefore, internally, there are bound to be members that have more influences than the others within the same community. To dismiss this means that it ignores the internal differences within a community and generalize them as the same thing.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To categorize the communities into one with influences and one without is not enough. The communities within the middle play a big role in the dynamic between the influential communities and the less influential communities. If one simply dismisses them, one will miss the big picture and fail to consider how the middle communities come into play to influence the other communities and come up with inaccurate conclusions. It will also dismiss the effort that less influential communities put in to try to raise awareness, though it might be small or less visible, that does not mean it does not exist. Moreover, to divide the communities up also means that one generalizes the communities. There are also different levels of influences within a community, without addressing them, one overlooks that all the communities are unique.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only does dividing the communities up only according to their influences will oppress the less powerful voices within a community, to divide the communities up through their positions will also cause the same problem. The position here refers to the hierarchy of power. In Srinivasan’s essay “Where Information Society and Community Voice Intersect”, he analyses Paulo Freire’s theory of pedagogy. Freire believes that in a lot of processes, in this case, the relationship between the teacher and the student, is divided into the oppressor-oppressed. He believes that: “Freedom entails rejecting the image of the oppressor and instead embracing the autonomy and collective responsibility common to all human beings” (356). To apply this to the communities means that there is a very clear-cut division between which communities belong to the oppressors and which belong to the oppressed. However, like the argument in the previous paragraph, there is no one definition to define everything and generalize them will only overlook the individuality within a community. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fandom community is a good example to show that it is impossible to divide the communities into two types: the oppressor and the oppressed. Nothing is so clear-cut, everything can be interpreted in multiple ways. For example, in 2015, Hollywood adapts The Man From U.N.C.L.E. into a movie. Therefore, there are now a fandom for the movie and a fandom for the TV show. Although it might seem that the movie fandom is the oppressor since it is newer and has more members, the two fandoms actually have some interactions and a lot of fans begin to watch the TV show because of the movie. To generalize the communities into two types will not only miss a lot of elements that are in-between, but simplified the situations into believing false assumptions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Externally, it is impossible to divide the communities up into the oppressor and the oppressed, so as internally. Srinivasan argues that Freire fails to take into considerations of the complex situations in-between: “His [Freire] concepts fall into the traditional Hegelian dialectic that lacks investigation into the multiple layers of meaning that generate the communities of oppressors and oppressed” (356). This paper will go further into argue that besides the investigations between the oppressors and the oppressed, it is also important to examine the complex construction within a single community. To view one community and labels it as either the oppressor or the oppressed generalize the communities and ignore the individuality within. This kind of method will further de-valued the smaller voices within the community because they are being viewed as the same as the other louder voices within the same community.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fandom in itself is also a complex being. Even within the same fandom, members will have different ideologies for the same thing they all enjoy. For example, in the Merlin fandom, some regard the plot as simply the adventure of a powerful sorcerer in a kingdom that forbids magic. However, some others interpret the story as the struggles of the LGBTQ+ society in which people are being prosecuted for what they are born with. To simply ignore the different voices within the same community is to ignore the individuality within it. Generalization will not help the members that are already in the disadvantaged positions within the community to be heard.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, to divide the communities up into the oppressor and the oppressed is not enough. Externally, it overlooks the fact that there are multiple elements in between the oppressor and the oppressed that cannot be easily categorized. Fail to consider that means that it does not take the multiple elements into account and will likely come down to a false conclusion. Internally, it is crucial to consider even within the same community, there are elements within that are different. To not generalize and realize that there are multiple sides in a single community is to acknowledge the different voices within. With this in mind, it will diminish the degree of how the less powerful voices within the same community are being oppressed. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides dividing the communities up into the oppressor and the oppressed, scholars also often categorize communities into ones with the power to represent, and the ones without. In Shilton and Srinivasan’s essay “Participatory Appraisal and Arrangement for Multicultural”, they discuss how it is important to rearrange the archival collections to make it fairer. They want to give back power to the communities, so they can represent themselves rather than being represented: “A key component within this shift will be to expand appraisal, arrangement, and description into tools designed to respect the knowledge systems embedded within community contexts” (4). Even though the intention is clearly positive, the argument fails to recognize that there are a lot of different types of communities in-between and it is impossible to categorize them into having full power to represent and the others do not. Power is not something a community has it all or has none, it often depends on how people view things and how the society behaves.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fandom community can illustrate that communities are not just the one with full power and the one without, they can represent a lot of things in-between. In various ways, the arts, posts, stories members in the fandom create can be considered as to have the power to represent. The ones they create might be adapted into something long term and whenever people talk about these specific aspects of fandom, the arts will be presented as a significant part of the fandom. However, a lot of times the creations from the members of the fandom will come and go, they might have some power at once, but it is not long term. Therefore, to conclude that a community represents complete power and the other has no power at all is insufficient and fails to recognize the middle ground.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To categorize communities into two types based on their powers also disregard the fact that communities have a lot of internal struggles. Within a community, there are a lot of differences. There are bound to be differences between communities, but also within them. Shilton and Srinivasan’s essay emphasizes that the archivists should be alongside the community members to resist objectification, but actively empower the records (6). However, different communities will have different definitions of power and this kind of power does not necessarily apply to all of the members of the same community. Some members might still be more powerful than the others, and their words and actions do not necessarily mean they represent the whole group. Therefore, to categorize communities into one with power to represent and the other does not fail to realize that within a community, there are also power struggles within, and what majority of the members believe do not mean every single member in them agrees.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The power struggle within is perfectly illustrated by the fandom community. It might be reasonable to think that everyone will believe or like the same thing since they belong to the same fandom. However, the notorious “fandom war” in which members argue or even fight with each other on how they believe should be the correct way of how the stories should go and how the characters should behave. One side might eventually have the upper hand, however, like the previous example, that does not mean every single member believe in it. To categorize the communities into two types is to generalize and disregard the individuals within the communities.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To categorize the communities into two types, one with power to represent and the other without is not a fair and just decision. Although the intention might be good, since they want to give more power to the ones that they consider as underrepresented. But by using this method, they forget to consider the middle ground that there are a lot of communities that are not necessarily powerful or powerless. This kind of method also fails to address the internal struggles within a community and consider all the members as the same. They ignore the fact that within a community, there are also people who have more power to represent than the others within the same community. By generalizing, the argument in the article puts the less powerful members in the same community in an even more disadvantaged position. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In conclusion, this paper argues that the approach of a lot of essays and articles that simply divides the communities into two types both externally and internally is not sufficient. Fail to acknowledge the middle area will result in faulty conclusions, since it does not consider the bigger picture of how all the different communities function and interact with each other. If one wants to solve the conflicts between communities, to simply divide communities up based on locations, resources, influences, and power, is not a suitable method. The reason is that there are plenty of other factors that cause mismatches, if one fails to consider them, the conflict will not be thoroughly examined and resolved. To divide the communities into two types also means that one ignores the individualities within it and looks at it as a whole. This approach disregards the fact that terms in each community have different definitions and interpretations. It is not enough to use only one point of view to look through everything. To view community as a whole and ignore the internal struggles within, rather than notice that individuals within the same community might have different opinions will result in putting the less powerful voices within the same community in an even more disadvantaged position, because one thinks the louder voices in it represent every single member. Although to divide the communities into two types might be a clearer and easier way to look at a situation, it should never be the only way. To consider the complex structures and elements that build up communities might be time-consuming, but it is a much better way to thoroughly understand how the communities function and interact with each other.</div><div><br></div></h3>
